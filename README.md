# HelloWorld
Please clone this repo and add your initials to the 
roster of people who have done their Coding Club push 
below!

The instructions below are designed for Git Bash or 
another console command Git environment.

Step 1: Make a folder on your local computer to house 'HelloWorld'

Step 2: While in the folder you just made use the command 
		'git clone {repository URL copied from green button in GitHub}'
		
Step 3: Edit this 'README.md' file locally on your computer to include
		your 'Hello world' or 'Killroy was here' or some such.
		
Step 4: In Git Bash use the command 'git status', the README file should
		appear red, show it has been changed but the changes have not 
		been staged to your git or commited.
		
Step 5: Type the command 'git add . ' to stage all changed files to your
		git backup structure. *Note: not fully backed up until next step*
		
Step 6: Use the command 'git commit -m "<insert description of change>" '
		where -m flags that there is a message and the message being what
		is between the quotation marks, such as "John Doe updated README"
		Your file is now backed up on your local git directory, but we
		must push it back to the GitHub site for online backup.
		
Step 7: Input 'git push origin main' to push the file up to the "origin"
		website location (you don't have to retype or repaste the website)
		with your edits on the "main" branch. 
		CONGRATS! You have just performed a git backup and GitHub push!
